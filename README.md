# poem_chopper_alpine
## To Do:

- Replace _lines_ with something loaded from a database

- Move garbled poem selection stuff server-side... upon API request, make a random selection from the data and deliver that. Don't deliver the whole damn thing.

- Make another request when the edited poem is submitted

- Make it Tailwind(?) Y'know, for kicks.

- Change the Leaflet tile layers so that it's cooler
