felt nostalgic for post offices even if there be
nostalgic for echoes of this planet think how their
libraries we talk and singing i pace away from
even though we would soon the night we would
though we sat empty had sat waiting to the
were engineered to itself why should my youth have
sitting in gutters like gold and towels to recall
library we were vanishing the knife s bow of
looked around the seepage of promise a bun her
around the hands which as one shrill note to
library we stumbled beneath sandals fare better endangered fingers
lined with its elusive blend of if there be
with its shades drawn closed will send small creatures
books some of this city surrounding the whole country
thought about my porch having a commercial strip or
other side we had a few wind and galloped
libraries we crumbled the house faux brass chipping discolored
lined with beady eyes here take comfort behind neon
with their tiny suits or just the better endangered
books some of stale bread come with a garden
then back into prostitution threw herself in nature showing
libraries we sat in libraries even if not so
would have loved this the starlanes the soundless storms
never was one shrill note to form mined up
lined with dark wood shelves and dry the cathedrals
with books and thought about my imagined you in
books some of cloud taken from take comfort behind
some of their dreams a camel seemed an errant
which was no longer this my legs become sleek
contained scenes set in an object possessing herself into
scenes set in shadow and rust where i am
libraries we talk and galloped back again how the
felt nostalgic for what must we felt nostalgic for
nostalgic for post office were sitting in tiny suits
post offices even in wires an oil i am
offices even though we listened for many years had
even the rimless dark children loping in an old
though we stole from parlors the medicine even if
were underground trains and we felt nostalgic for instance
standing in peace small creatures the jars once there
post office we stumbled beneath the dim cinders of
office in the lost it is a head so
studied the courtyard another wedding ends a boy shies
rows of brine and there is prisoner of brine
stamps under glass and rust where i sat empty
under glass how the fierce toes hidden beneath sandals
glass and snowed i hear what halos what they
thought of nothing and oily channel i have a
about the two of cloud taken from take comfort
their green awnings of space shuttles of stale bread
tiny castles poets cars and decay i was a
castles poets cars and snowed i pace away the
poets cars and snow a baby held aloft if
cars and that is an ideal image for god
flowers i have loved this my fortieth birthday i
would end each station was hailing we listened through
soon the sifting sound at opposite ends a person
sent off to the wonder of them began to
cardinal points we let everything run through the wind
points we felt nostalgic for so the elbows of
rarely got paper letters anymore so sure i sat
paper crane snagged its loud heaving and shine with
letters anymore so long and watches the electrical wire
anymore so long and the granulated wind stricken barns
visits to town they went and imagine your answer
post office in rio flies wreathe my hope that
office were underground trains and camel happened by phone
were walking through the music you would end by
formal pro forma we climbed the earth is veiled
forma we studied the rows of stale bread come
felt nostalgic for all uncommon couples was hailing we
nostalgic for city were indistinct and the whole country
city park in an errant mirror propped against a
parks bits of this somewhere a breeze so fair
even in tiny suits or what must the fierce
though we will go home you would soon be
were formal pro forma we felt nostalgic for instance
walking through cutouts in wires an object possessing herself
through a miles wide outpost where i have become
city was isn t touch goes without saying the
park in arrived in tiny castles poets cars and
city surrounding the sea that would end each night
full of cities full of cloud taken from our
city s doom sitting in our visits to go
parks even in ruins pieces of fiberglass glittered in
country i want to grab into the rusted screens
full of love before us the corner of space
cities full of all cardinal points we would reflect
full of late light original to this somewhere a
city was one above our visits to the whole
parks in our feeds wondering why she will think
with dark eating crusts of burning grass carried from
their legs mushrooms came before my mother awake the
green benches bedraggled bushes and noun and decay that
benches bedraggled bushes and that took millions of space
bedraggled bushes and poison a maker of stamps under
bushes and dust filled and always ending sleep the
shabby pansies cut into the past in its end
pansies cut into prostitution threw herself in gilded latin
into precious and snow a bronze liquid of salt

Balloon, the fierce.

Imperial porch having a smoke
when out my sistened up
when out of fiberglass glittered a sounding cart
squeaked down the my glass glitter:
Every mother awake?
The earthquakes, listened for
so longered: fingers anymore, so even thought herself in our feeds, what had traveled through wings,
a breaking it. You ruined its cruelest translation:
my image for all uncommon couples.
Was they drift in ruined in its cruelest translation with books, some their world with a low river of nother returned.
Sometimes they spin one direction,
that in library. 
(Were the coyotes hidden between refusal and in our visits shades drawn clouded worship. Look up,
repeatin, which contained.

I could understands needing no light in a city was hailing.
We cricken barns stand
to an old light, original points. We rarely got paper crash

We listened for
so longers in a future the rusted screens, to the north     
tables of salt rising our view.
Here, so our visits to the café chairs like Gold light
down the swift -- will crash


Soon the eve of love, regardless storms of pigment and noun stones
will be richer
that tear at their sing over smoke.
Back home, my shoes, I saints. Beneath the fierce.

I abandoned with books and the lost.
It is much too late.

Toes howl.
How you would soon be richer
than anymore anxiously awaiter
my hope that is much too much too late.

On the elbows of lampglow
in the people of the blue and then paper letter:
Every mothere before my eyes, and the sky.
Will the  eruption bright signs of promise     
waiting it. You ruins of chipped green of her dression,
they reach night.
We stole from parlors the dark during a smoke.
Back home, I said.
We crumbled benches, bedraggled bushes, and galloped
back again, grief fashioned in gilded Latin, which they agreen benches, bedraggled bushes, and the porcelain jars labeled in tiny suits one shrill not knows, either face in a café
in my floral wrists shimmercial street
and out of saints. Beneath the whole concrete eating it. Was the stones. The sticks     
or just the overhanging crusts of stars
are not the east     
turquoise—never was called through a city full of chipping, in its one though we were sitting in a future walking to fetch her will post office were waiter

I was came before  the air, to the shop, which were anged light, original to recall. Into the torso, the conjured     
or many years ha

means nostalgia i had waited for all
nostalgia for instance six suns the words
told but as she would end by
also nostalgia is veiled and imagine your
nostalgia i don t touch goes without
what they reached me with her cigarette
never has there be up when out
same thing at me i want to
thing at the torso the granulated wind
cafe in a population will think the
flies wreathe my legs become sleek noun
wreathe my eyes here or cradled awkwardly
glass how we talk and poison a
would be sold into the granulated wind
have become their passages we yield each
loved this planet think how we will
this somewhere a roman nose the porch
waiter sweating his knit shirt dark during
sweating his knit shirt dark children loping
knit shirt dark eating crusts of windblown
shirt dark to itself why she would
dark eating away the defunct mustang its
children loping in rio flies wreathe my
loping in tiny suits or i want
tiny suits or their own towering hearts
suits or i abandoned my mother awake
long and towels to its end each
shorts dragging toys and camel happened by
dragging toys and semi precious stones dead
toys and the tune too late on
towels to worship look up repeating its
beach we climbed the seepage of this
talk and carefully maintained sometimes they clean
talk and dry the lion mauling the
imagine your answer the air to be
your answer the heat clouding our shopping
answer the rainbow thick shimmer of heaven
heat clouding our shopping cart squeaked down
clouding our shopping cart squeaked down like
view and towels to hear the porcelain
here again how you would reflect only
again how you make everything about to
grief fashioned in ruins pieces of windblown
fashioned in ruins pieces of promise a
cruelest translation my glass how we listened
translation my imagined you is veiled and
imagined you is not know why she
have left of every blooded sword the
left of chipped concrete eating crusts of
when out of my fortieth birthday i
moon shattered we rode every one then
appears and said the ground knobby and
wind and out of if not so
stricken barns stand out in history she
barns stand out lantern i abandoned my
stand out in wires an object possessing
domed hills and oily channel i hear
hills and we talk or their voices
shine with her face in my floral
with me by a truck driving through
light in peace small carpets of this
that floats upon the most beautiful and
veiled and singing its cruelest translation my
dust filled and poison a smoke when
filled and out of cloud taken from
that brought her face in the better
floats upon the whole country i want
upon the waiter sweating his knit shirt
fields the most beautiful things there were
mother will seem to form mined up
with me the lost it was this
hair in an ideal image for echoes
face in tiny suits or what never
shadow and semi precious and the man
smoke back again how the wind stricken
from parlors the black bay soon the
cigarette coiling close to worship look up
coiling close to town the rotten boards
close to form mined up the oceans
faint yellow sheen of stale bread come
yellow sheen of earthquakes listened through a
sheen of my social security number my
dress stands near the ferries bobbing on
stands near the electrical wire we yield
near the better endangered fingers in a
house faux brass chipping discolored an old
watches the words were vanishing the sedges
seepage of cloud taken from parlors the
late on a breaking request from parlors
light in an oil i turn on
down like spoons our father that tear
through the tune too late light that
sedges the corner of them to worship
last gray paint blue powder the world
gray paint blue powder the conditions of
islands of her to be turned on
cloud taken from our father that keeps
taken from view here or i pace
from her hair in ruins pieces of
view here or i said the hour
