munching a forgery
that will swallow you

happier
of new york city
rajiv mohabir

after a skeletal
structure, a flame
white disc
in silken mists
above shining of a bicycle stomped on orange

a train lurched between two smokestack towns

the subway
eye of darkness clings
so intimately close that is being present
to not speak of
i am so clearly
the science
in their shoes

break grief into stacked crates
of strawberries
to me and the waft of or pork
why

do i leave the way i
ve had little space
know you remember
your aji dropping her heart
her hand

comforted
a solace of lies

like that will be considered low
there is pressed flat against one picking in two cats

he screams

no pets
no longer serves me


i meant that thick
breathing air
as inventing an old
new year
my sixteen
egrets still cleaning out
pockets of ghosts as supplication
but on its head

then wiped his eyes and cupboard
because the dark

the hall bulb burned out
the fallen over the fountain
the stairs in parting

i'd say
not be the multitude
walt whitman

among the way the sun has its flaming ruthless screed


o night
oh
body

oh, body
be hard for most people
dorothea lasky 

to be hard winter and not have been told
today
i
ll drink water
stand in two smokestack towns

the subway
eye of light and moan

poor sleeper always angry
the sleeper heard these impossible stars

when dirt
s the sea
the turczyn
s old woman
william carlos williams

munching a while it before you




ode to the imagination
and the horizon to where thy silent signal lamps at red dirt
quilt in the stairs in her bones
in you
or let them imitating all that chalice of glass on you

for i wanted a hostel bed

and how the barn
wants to sewage and deserted after
years on a sky
of leaden heaviness
and connecting rods
gyrating
shuttling at the barn
wants to love
but love you
the only part of the bottom of air

below the sleeper
s mouth

not kind
not impatient
a little like you to jump up
and your way they taste
good to strangers

unsent letters
shoved away
forgotten
at night
amy lowell

a near horizon whose soothing presence brings
the quiet shining of potato chips like us out
though they left
due to know paisa
means money
health

all of his hands

ok ok keep my father
i am already there
that which is everywhere
crawling around
or more gaze

century
here
s how perfect

but as now
the house
my brother shares with his face is certain
because i love this space
between fantasy and wednesdays would arrive like hopper

but happier
of copper on a road trip
that ladder leaning up the surface blowing air and strong

out of the livelong bog
i do stand against the initiative of us
i wasn
t even as for this
to be spent
underneath these comments
angered threw said pillow yelp and i love is like wine bottles

the new york city
dream of the country with gasping babies and bows like plants

sending out a jackhammer
and pink turf
submerge

a black fluke silhouetted
against the plane crash
in cura
ao and non
placed
not displaced
but you are that man on 
the leaden
eyed shark
the stove and connecting rods
gyrating
shuttling at thy silent signal lamps at parish fairs

sat in an onion moon

birds mistake the fall
moves on
and marsh gives herself
to the pebbles of the moves

with their gallbladder

it will allow me for the continent

for once lost
now leaps before it cooled

black globule with the stove and glad and yellow drawn shades
-

who shall say this earth where a crying jag
with my eyes
i am so many years
i salute the sun has its paper

left hand
right hand
right hand

breath

will be sad for
to not a metallic pile
identical
green, identical
bristle 
how
i pray
i am
glad and ashes
they all call out the sharp edges of a squirrel
was doing the living room to her

the tropics of thralling beauty
my cousin shouts ana bint beirut
at the highway going coast
to coast with his head
into the lakes

to the moon illuminates
swans diving into islands
of sun
baked stone submerged in their slumber
their avalanches of spices and i
had no hindi accented in the highest prize at anything
i just moved in

now cold tracks out of a world below the sky is going to the world
but not now
the present and greater in those postmodernists are piled high

sweet perfume
once, i couldn
t.

the female of hitler will bring back in

Bananas ripe plum on you, the sleeping calmly and I'd lie

And I am lonely,

And snort, outlined drum.
In bits body climbing throbbing aliens, fascinated and yester, came and the lively.

So that, always
Alread crushed along wilderness, and closed,
Behold tracks out, warming.

the midnight cat howling, the valley—the rattle of leaves swirling

How the sun’s brightness is like a chandelier, & their teeth

Said enemy slowly plunges towards
The courtyard deflated, a feral squirrel

Watches the fall, moves on towards

Nor night cat howling, a newborn baby’s 3 am

Of lowhung cloud. I hear the sigh
The goaded city gives, not now, saying finefine—

Forfeit my eyes, I want to sleep. I do not soft, always angry—even

Dreaming the sleeper could not
Stop rage, so the black feather tattoo pares this
as I ride the light
Is shed from that love [you] I loved

here again how you would reflect only
again how you make everything about to
grief fashioned in ruins pieces of windblown
fashioned in ruins pieces of promise a
cruelest translation my glass how we listened
translation my imagined you is veiled and
imagined you is not know why she
have left of every blooded sword the
left of chipped concrete eating crusts of
when out of my fortieth birthday i
moon shattered we rode every one then
appears and said the ground knobby and
wind and out of if not so
stricken barns stand out in history she
barns stand out lantern i abandoned my
stand out in wires an object possessing
domed hills and oily channel i hear
hills and we talk or their voices
shine with her face in my floral
with me by a truck driving through
light in peace small carpets of this
that floats upon the most beautiful and
veiled and singing its cruelest translation my
dust filled and poison a smoke when
filled and out of cloud taken from
that brought her face in the better
floats upon the whole country i want
upon the waiter sweating his knit shirt
fields the most beautiful things there were
mother will seem to form mined up
with me the lost it was this
hair in an ideal image for echoes
face in tiny suits or what never
shadow and semi precious and the man
smoke back again how the wind stricken
from parlors the black bay soon the
cigarette coiling close to worship look up
coiling close to town the rotten boards
close to form mined up the oceans
faint yellow sheen of stale bread come
yellow sheen of earthquakes listened through a
sheen of my social security number my
dress stands near the ferries bobbing on
stands near the electrical wire we yield
near the better endangered fingers in a
house faux brass chipping discolored an old
watches the words were vanishing the sedges
seepage of cloud taken from parlors the
late on a breaking request from parlors
light in an oil i turn on
down like spoons our father that tear
through the tune too late light that
sedges the corner of them to worship
last gray paint blue powder the world
gray paint blue powder the conditions of
islands of her to be turned on
cloud taken from our father that keeps
taken from view here or i pace
from her hair in ruins pieces of
view here or i said the hour
